# {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}

## Your Time

There are approximately 1,000 minutes in a 16-hour day. (Source: [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html).) This breaks down into 100 10-minute blocks. Ask yourself:
- How many of these blocks are you putting towards improving your future, and how many are just to be enjoyed?
- How many are used to create something, and how many are used to consume something?
- How many blocks are focused on your body, how many on your mind, and how many on neither in particular?
- Which are your favorite blocks of the day, and which are your least favorite?
- Which blocks should be treated as non-negotiable in their labeled purpose, and which should be more flexible?
